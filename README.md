8/27:
1st Day. Currently considering Mistral 7b as it is lightweight and free as well as open source. Will look into creating a Webscraper to get the data

Met w/ Justin. May reduce scope to general occidental info on the school. To say how I can do this, I will need to scrape the website and see how much data I have to work with. So for now work on building the webscraper. Downloaded Mistral 7B today. Should ask how I should justify picking it.


11/2: Task List for the day

1. Create a way to evaluate how much more accurate my RAG search becomes when I add to it (Ex: Preprocessing, CoT)
2. Create a UI to interact with the RAG app
3. Link chatgpt 4o to my app (or some other llm)
